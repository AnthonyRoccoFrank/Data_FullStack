# Flu Vaccine vs. Flu Burden: An ETL Stack Project
Adrian Aguilar | Annie Donnelly | Anthony Rocco-Frank | Brinda Sanchania | Randie Sinclair

- The project is an ETL project where we collected flu and vaccine data from the CDC, and looked to draw a comparison between Flu Vaccine distribution, and the Flu Burden between the years 2011 and 2021.

### PLEASE READ BEFORE LAUNCHING [WEBSITE](https://randiesinclair.github.io/Project3-Data_FullStack/): 
Since the data that feeds the charts is not hosted online, you will need to run the following steps to obtain the data to fill the charts so they generate locally:
- Run the Load.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook to put the necessary files into a database
  - This only needs to be done one time
- In the app.py file, start a terminal and start the API Flask by using the following command: python app.py
  - This will need to be done every time you launch the page

Only then will the proper data generate, and the charts will load properly. Enjoy!
