            <p>Flu seasons are unpredictable in a number of ways, including when they begin, how severe they are, how long they last, which viruses will spread, and whether the viruses in the vaccine match flu viruses that are circulating.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Below is a mixed chart that compares two data sets over a period of 10 years. The data being represented on the line chart is the total doses distributed. There are mulitple datapoints within a single year showing how it progressed over a series of weeks</p> 
            <br>
            <p>The bar chart provides a visual representation of the relationship between the number of symptomatic illnesses (per 100,0000). Together both charts show a relationship between doses given and the burden of symptomatic illnesses from 2011 to 2021. No data for 2020 was registered as there was a Covid pandemic resulting in quarantine, minimizing any flu data.</p>
